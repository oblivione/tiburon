1. For the ones working on UI - NEVER update the UI on a callback.
Initialize a timer which does the needful. If multiple callbacks occur,
since multiple threads will try to access the same UI element at the
same time, segmentation fault will occur. 

2. To give any USB device a constant name so that even if the port
changes on reconnecting it, do the following
$ udevinfo -a -p $(udevinfo -q path -n /dev/ttyUSB0) 
Here ttyUSB0 is the device which is under consideration
$ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-tiburonRules.rules
The files are executed in lexicographical order. So ensure that your
rule starts with the proper name
$ ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001",SYMLINK+="auv_vn100"
Only attributes within one device section may be used together in one
rule, to match the device for which the link will be created
$ sudo service udev restart
Restart udev and reconnect the device. The link will be created.
